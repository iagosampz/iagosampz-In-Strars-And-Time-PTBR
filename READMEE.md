# About
</div>
In Stars and Time is a time loop adventure RPG created by insertdisc5 and published by Armor Games Studios, originally released on November 20, 2023.
<br>
The game unfortunately does not have an official translation for the Brazilian public, which is currently the first country in Latin America with the largest game sales market and as in stars and time
is an incredible RPG, having its beautiful rating of 8.3 on meta critic why not translate it?

# About the project
</div>
The project is currently in its development phase, where we intend to publish it in the Brazilian fall of 2025,
along with the translation there will be some adaptations to improve the understanding of some lines,
along with that the game settings are translated
and lastly some plugins and photos were translated
and etc...

# Installation
</div>

1. The game must be in version v1.0.6.3 otherwise the translation will not work

2. From the zip file that you are accessing this `README.md`, there should be a folder called `"www"`, simply select it in Winrar.

3. After selecting the folder, click on “extract to”.

4. The location where you need to extract the folder is in the game's general folder, the IN STARS AND TIME folder, it is usually located in: `Program Files (x86)` -> `Steam` -> `steamapps` -> `common` -> `In Stars And Time` (extract the folder there).

5. Winrar will ask if you would like to replace files, click “Yes”.

6. Now just start the game using the Steam “start” button, if the game's warning screen is translated, it means that the translation was applied successfully.
